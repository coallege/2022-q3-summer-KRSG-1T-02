# part2

Based on the readings:

- How did hooks and Grande meet the challenges of the new worlds they entered?

Grande seemed to notice that the whole "academic" setting ate away at her roots and actively worked to reclaim them through language and presentation.

- How did their past experiences and knowledge contribute to their sense of power, or sense of belonging, in a new university environment?
- How did dialogue and collaboration contribute to their learning, and to their sense of strength and agency in their communities? What if there were a single skill that could directly and radically improve your relationships and your emotional life?
