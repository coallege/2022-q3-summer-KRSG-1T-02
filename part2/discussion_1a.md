Based on reading and viewing the above information, discuss (write) a response to ONE of the three questions below. Include TWO thought provoking questions regarding How to Stay on Top of It and Six Strategies for Effective Learning, for others to consider and respond.

How do you want your reading to change, to become more rewarding, fulfilling, or productive?
What does your reading say about you as a person? Does it define you as a person? Does it gain you entry into or exclude you from any groups or activities?
Have you ever found yourself reading, and as you read, an area of your life that felt stuck, unsure, or even painful, seemed to open with new possibilities or thoughts? Did you unexpectedly discover a new kind of power as you read? How did you put that power to use? If not, what kept you from taking that power on.

- Taking notes = bad is rote memorizatoin bad?

When I read I don't absorb a lot of information.
Usually the case is that I can't really remember it very well
I don't think my working memory is very good and the processes that I have to commit whatever I read to memory are unpracticed.
I'm not used to having to put in actual effort to try and learn things because I don't generally try and learn things that are out of my comfort zone. As such, I don't actually really need to create new mental models and all information just kinda filter feeds into what I already know.

I need to come up with more effective strategies on retaining what I know when I read. So that could be re-reading it or whatever.

In the "How to Stay on Top of It" reading, they mention taking notes and actually trying to engage with the content helps people remember things at a more "enhanced" level. I've never enjoyed the concept of taking notes because to me it felt like if I had to take notes, I didn't actually understand what I was learning or reading. Is memorizing stuff good? I have my own opinion on this but I think I'm supposed to leave it open-ended.

I've found that interlacing hasn't worked as well for me. Swapping between studying certain subjects means that my memory just gets more jumbled in my head. Maybe the idea behind it is that it's supposed to give your brain a break from processing one specific subject? Be curious to hear other people's thoughts on it (if I didn't submit this so late).
