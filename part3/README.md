Based on the readings:

- How did hooks and Grande meet the challenges of the new worlds they entered?
- How did their past experiences and knowledge contribute to their sense of power, or sense of belonging, in a new university environment?
- How did dialogue and collaboration contribute to their learning, and to their sense of strength and agency in their communities? What if there were a single skill that could directly and radically improve your relationships and your emotional life?
